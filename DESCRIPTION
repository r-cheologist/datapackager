Description: A package to setup and maintain an R package skeleton that allows
    for easy integration of data sets into packages documenting their analysis.
    A centrally supported use case is the separate distribution of packaged data
    analysis and any data sets addressed, where strong cryptographic hashing is
    used to ensure data integrity/match between analysis and data.
